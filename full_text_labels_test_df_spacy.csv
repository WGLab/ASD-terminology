3051,ASD,asd,PMC5416705.txt,23200,23203,This finding raises the question whether oxytocin may enhance social attention in ASD as a function of social anxiety by decreasing perceptions of social threat and associated arousal.
3052,ASD,asd,PMC5416705.txt,24094,24097,This suggests that oxytocin might counteract the effortful withdrawal of attention from social cues in anxious individuals with ASD.

5449,autism,autism,PMC6044100.txt,54994,55000,Overall the general focus of guidelines was to outline a framework to find the best way to decide whether autism is present or not around a threshold of symptom severity.

10278,ASD,asd,PMC6053619.txt,48318,48321,These results advance our understanding of the links between the social and sensory features of ASD by examining a processing mechanism that impacts on both social and non-social stimuli and specifically addressing whether adaptation of these cues is differentially impaired.
